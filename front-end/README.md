# Courses: front-end

## Dotenv

To get this demo up and running, you'll need to create a **.env** file in you root project directory (on the same level as .gitignore). The contents should look like this:

```properties
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = http://localhost:3000
```

## Install and start Next.js app

Start the development server by opening a terminal in the `front-end` folder and running:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm start

```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
